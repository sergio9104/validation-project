# README for Localized React Application

## Application Description
This React application provides a seamless experience for users across different locales, specifically supporting Ukrainian (UA), English (EN), and French (FR). Built on the power of React and harnessing the capabilities of `i18next`, our app ensures accurate translation, currency representation, date/time formatting, and number formatting tailored to the user's chosen locale. Besides these, the application has inbuilt functionality to handle missed translations, making sure the user experience remains unhindered. The app has been developed adhering to high standards, ensuring no commented or unused code in the source, and no console errors.

## Running the Application Locally
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
3. Navigate to the app directory.
   ```
   cd [app-directory]
   ```
4. Install the required packages.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the application.
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Switching Locale
The application supports dynamic locale switching. You can set your preferred locale through the URL's query parameters. Here are some examples:

1. For English:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000?lang=en
   ```

2. For French:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000?lang=fr
   ```

To use other supported locales, simply replace the `lang` query parameter's value with the desired locale (e.g., `ua` for Ukrainian).

## Additional Features
- **Number Formatting**: Numbers are automatically formatted according to the chosen locale's standards.
  
- **Date/Time Formatting**: Our application ensures date and time are displayed as per local customs of the selected locale.
  
- **Currency Display**: Currencies are represented in the format familiar to the chosen locale.
  
- **Missed Translations Handling**: In case a translation is missing, the application has logic to handle it gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Thank you for choosing our localized React application! We hope it serves your needs aptly.
