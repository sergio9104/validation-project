# README for Localized React Application

## Application Description

Welcome to our React-based web application that sets a new standard in multilingual support. Designed specifically to cater to audiences from diverse linguistic backgrounds, this application comes with built-in support for Ukrainian (UA), English (EN), and French (FR). It's not just about translations; it's about a localized experience. Every aspect, be it currency representation, date/time formatting, or number visualization, has been meticulously tailored to resonate with the locale's norms and standards.

Harnessing the robust capabilities of `i18next`, this application guarantees an unhindered and smooth user experience even in the face of missed translations. Its architecture ensures there are no console errors, and its source code is optimized, free from redundant commented sections or unused methods. With a strong emphasis on providing a seamless and native experience for each supported language, this application is your perfect solution for a truly internationalized web presence.

## Running the Application Locally
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sergio9104/validation-project
   ```
3. Navigate to the app directory.
   ```
   cd validation-project/my-app
   ```
4. Install the required packages.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the application.
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Switching Locale
The application supports dynamic locale switching. You can set your preferred locale through the URL's query parameters. Here are some examples:

1. For English:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000?lang=en
   ```

2. For French:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000?lang=fr
   ```

To use other supported locales, simply replace the `lang` query parameter's value with the desired locale (e.g., `uk` for Ukrainian).

## Additional Features
- **Number Formatting**: Numbers are automatically formatted according to the chosen locale's standards.
  
- **Date/Time Formatting**: Our application ensures date and time are displayed as per local customs of the selected locale.
  
- **Currency Display**: Currencies are represented in the format familiar to the chosen locale.
  
- **Missed Translations Handling**: In case a translation is missing, the application has logic to handle it gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Thank you for choosing our localized React application! We hope it serves your needs aptly.
